#### About Me:
I'm really passionate about turning challenges into opportunities, especially when it comes to showing that tech can be fun and engaging for everyone. Drawing on my background as a fine artist, I found my niche in crafting visual stories from complex data. This blend allows me to transform complex data sets into engaging, easy-to-understand visual narratives, making data not just accessible but genuinely captivating.

Currently, I'm completing additional certifications in Machine Learning and AWS Architect Solutions while honing my skills in Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
